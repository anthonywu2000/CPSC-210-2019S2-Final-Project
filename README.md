# CPSC-210-2019S2-Final-Project
Created a SmartBanking Application that allows users to monitor their balance, savings, and credit card account. The app also enables users to make payment for the credit card from their balance account, deposit money into their balance and savings accounts, and make transactions from their balance or savings account. The app itself includes some security features such as creating a username and password. The app also allows users to look up for the most recent currency exchange rate with USD being the source of conversion. 

Programmed in Java (using Swing GUI, API, and JSON parsing).
